        "In 2020, Alfa Romeo celebrated the 110th anniversary of their founding with the release of the 'GTA' and 'GTAm' special models of the Giulia. The output of the 2.9L V6 twin-turbo engine has been increased to 532.5 BHP, with further performance improvements in the form of weight reduction and an increased track width. The GTAm model is also designed with circuit use in mind, adding a large front splitter, carbon fibre rear wing and roll bars for a hardcore setup."

The TTS model is the leading sports model of the line-up and is equipped with the 4-cylinder turbo 2.0 TFSI engine tuned up to 309.7 BHP/38 kgfm (for the German domestic model.)

        "Hyundai's rear-wheel drive Genesis sports car has been modified to meet Gr.3 regulations for this Gran Turismo Original. With its over 2,800 mm long wheelbase, the car achieves both high stability and a powerful downforce from its large floor surface area. The V6 engine, though naturally aspirated, still produces over 493.1 BHP. It's a balanced machine that can handle both corners and straights."

      "descriptionText": "Dr. Ferdinand Porsche's Volkswagen was developed into a wide range of variants. One of which was the Sambabus, which transformed the car into a van with a large luggage space. By mounting the horizontally-opposed engine at the very back of the vehicle, it was possible to create a wide and low floor space while maintaining the compact size. This versatility gave the model a number of advantages as a commercial vehicle."
